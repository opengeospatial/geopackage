=== Other Data Tables

Application-specific or vendor-specific data tables that do not conform to the table definitions or other requirements
for storing feature data, raster or tile data, or metadata as defined in other sections of this document MAY be defined
and used to store supplemental information in a GeoPackage database. Such other data tables MAY be described by rows in
the `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys`, `gpkg_contents`, `gpkg_extensions`, `gpkg_data_columns`, `gpkg_metadata` and
`gpkg_metadata_reference` tables. GeoPackage applications MAY ignore such descriptive rows and other data tables they do
not recognize. Such other data tables SHALL NOT be described by rows in the `gpkg_geometry_columns` or
`gpkg_tile_matrix_metadata` tables.
