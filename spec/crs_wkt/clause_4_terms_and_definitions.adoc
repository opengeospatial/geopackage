== Terms and Definitions
This document used the terms defined in https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/directives/directives.php[OGC Policy Directive 49], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard and OGC documents do not use the equivalent phrases in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

This document also uses terms defined in the OGC Standard for Modular specifications (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3]), also known as the 'ModSpec'. The definitions of terms such as standard, specification, requirement, and conformance test are provided in the ModSpec.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

coordinate epoch::
A property of coordinates referenced to a dynamic coordinate reference system indicating the date at which the coordinates are valid. (SOURCE: OGC 18-005r4)

Coordinate Reference System (CRS)::
A coordinate reference system is a set of mathematical rules for specifying how coordinates are to be assigned to a point that is related to an object by a datum. (SOURCE: ISO 19111:2019)

[NOTE]
====
The GeoPackage Encoding Standard (GES) uses the term "spatial reference system (SRS)," though technically an SRS is a spatial reference either by coordinates (CRS) or by geographic identifier (e.g., post code / zip code or street address).
In the GES, a spatial reference system is realized through a row in the `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys` table.
====

well-known text (WKT)::
A compact machine- and human-readable representation of geometric objects that may also be used for succinctly describing the critical elements of CRS definitions. (SOURCE: OGC 18-010r7)

[NOTE]
====
CRS WKT2 specifically refers to a document conforming to the latest revision of OGC 18-010.
