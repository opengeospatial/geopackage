== Base

The required capabilities specified in this clause serve as the base for options specified in clause <<_options>> and extensions specified in clause <<registered_extensions>>.
All gpkg_* tables and views and all tiles user data tables specified in this standard SHALL have only the specified columns and table constraints. Any features user data tables MAY have columns in addition to those specified.
All specified table, view, column, trigger, and constraint name values SHALL be lowercase.

=== Core

The mandatory core capabilities defined in sub clauses and requirement statements of this clause SHALL be implemented by every *GeoPackage* and *GeoPackage SQLite Configuration*.

==== SQLite Container

The SQLite software library provides a self-contained, single-file, cross-platform, serverless, transactional, open source RDBMS container.
The GeoPackage standard defines a SQL database schema designed for use with the SQLite software library.
Using SQLite as the basis for GeoPackage simplifies production, distribution and use of GeoPackages and assists in guaranteeing the integrity of the data they contain.

“Self-contained” means that container software requires very minimal support from external libraries or from the operating system.
“Single-file” means that a container not currently opened by any software application consists of a single file in a file system supported by a computing platform operating system.
“Cross-platform” means that a container file MAY be created and loaded with data on one computing platform, and used and updated on another, even if they use different operating systems, file systems, and byte order (endian) conventions.
“Serverless” means that the RDBMS container is implemented without any intermediary server process, and accessed directly by application software.
“Transactional” means that RDBMS transactions guarantee that all changes to data in the container are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable (ACID) despite program crashes, operating system crashes, and power failures.

===== Data

====== File Format

:req1_foot1: footnote:[SQLite version 4 (reference B25), which will be an alternative to version 3, not a replacement thereof, was not available when this standard was written. See Future Work clause in Annex B.]
:req1_foot2: footnote:[SQLite is in the public domain (see http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html)]
:req2_foot1: footnote:[With SQLite versions 3.7.17 and later this value MAY be set with the "PRAGMA application_id=1196437809;" SQL statement, where 1196437809 is the 32-bit integer value of 0x47503131. With earlier versions of SQLite the application id can be set by writing the byte sequence 0x47, 0x50, 0x31, 0x31 at offset 68 in the SQLite database file (see http://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html#database_header for details).]

[requirement]
A GeoPackage SHALL be a http://www.sqlite.org/[SQLite] <<5>> database file using http://sqlite.org/fileformat2.html[version 3 of the SQLite file format] <<6>> <<7>>.
The first 15 bytes of a GeoPackage SHALL contain “SQLite format 3” {req1_foot1} in ASCII <<B4>>. {req1_foot2}

[requirement]
A GeoPackage SHALL contain 0x47503131 ("GP11" in ASCII) in the application id field of the SQLite database header to indicate a GeoPackage version 1.1 file. {req2_foot1}

The maximum size of a GeoPackage file is about 140TB.
In practice a lower size limit MAY be imposed by the filesystem to which the file is written.
Many mobile devices require external memory cards to be formatted using the FAT32 file system which imposes a maximum size limit of 4GB.

====== File Extension Name

[requirement]
A GeoPackage SHALL have the file extension name “.gpkg”.

It is RECOMMENDED that Extended GeoPackages use the file extension “.gpkx”, but this is NOT a GeoPackage requirement.

====== File Contents

[requirement]
A GeoPackage SHALL only contain data elements, SQL constructs and GeoPackage extensions with the “gpkg” author name specified in this encoding standard.

In order to guarantee maximum interoperability between applications, GeoPackages SHALL NOT contain data elements (tables or columns), SQL constructs (data types, indexes, constraints or triggers) or extensions that are not specified in this encoding standard.
SQLite databases that use constructs from the GeoPackage standard but extend those constructs to contain elements not specified in the core GeoPackage standard are referred to as Extended GeoPackages throughout this standard.

[requirement]
The columns of tables in a GeoPackage SHALL only be declared using one of the data types specified in table <<table_column_data_types>>.

==== Contents

===== Data

====== Table Definition

[requirement]
A GeoPackage file SHALL include a `gpkg_contents` table per table <<gpkg_contents_cols>> and <<gpkg_contents_sql>>.

The purpose of the `gpkg_contents` table is to provide identifying and descriptive information that an application can display to a user in a menu of geospatial data that is available for access and/or update.

|=======================================================================

The `gpkg_contents` table is intended to provide a list of all geospatial contents in a GeoPackage.
The `data_type` specifies the type of content.
The bounding box (`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`) provides an informative bounding box (not necessarily minimum bounding box) of the content.
If the `srs_id` column value references a geographic coordinate reference system (CRS), then the min/max x/y values are in decimal degrees; otherwise, the srs_id references a projected CRS and the min/max x/y values are in the units specified by that CRS.

See <<gpkg_contents_sql>>.

====== Table Data Values

[requirement]
The `table_name` column value in a `gpkg_contents` table row SHALL contain the name of a SQLite table or view.
