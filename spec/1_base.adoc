== Base

The required capabilities specified in this clause serve as the base for options specified in clause <<_options>> and extensions specified in clause <<registered_extensions>>.
All gpkg_* tables and views and all tiles user data tables specified in this standard SHALL have only the specified columns and table constraints. Any features user data tables MAY have columns in addition to those specified.
All specified table, view, column, trigger, and constraint name values SHALL be lowercase.

=== Core

The mandatory core capabilities defined in sub clauses and requirement statements of this clause SHALL be implemented by every *GeoPackage* and *GeoPackage SQLite Configuration*.

==== SQLite Container

The SQLite software library provides a self-contained, single-file, cross-platform, serverless, transactional, open source RDBMS container.
The GeoPackage standard defines a SQL database schema designed for use with the SQLite software library.
Using SQLite as the basis for GeoPackage simplifies production, distribution and use of GeoPackages and assists in guaranteeing the integrity of the data they contain.

"Self-contained" means that container software requires very minimal support from external libraries or from the operating system.
"Single-file" means that a container not currently opened by any software application consists of a single file in a file system supported by a computing platform operating system.
"Cross-platform" means that a container file MAY be created and loaded with data on one computing platform, and used and updated on another, even if they use different operating systems, file systems, and byte order (endian) conventions.
"Serverless" means that the RDBMS container is implemented without any intermediary server process, and accessed directly by application software.
"Transactional" means that RDBMS transactions guarantee that all changes to data in the container are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable (ACID) despite program crashes, operating system crashes, and power failures.

===== Data

====== File Format

[[r1]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 1
====
A GeoPackage SHALL be a http://www.sqlite.org/[SQLite] <<5>> database file using http://sqlite.org/fileformat2.html[version 3 of the SQLite file format] <<6>> <<7>>.
The first 16 bytes of a GeoPackage SHALL be the null-terminated ASCII <<B4>> string "SQLite format 3" ^<<K1>>^ ^<<K2>>^
====

[[r2]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 2
====
A GeoPackage SHALL contain a value of 0x47504B47 ("GPKG" in ASCII) in the "application_id" field of the SQLite database header to indicate that it is a GeoPackage. ^<<K3>>^ A GeoPackage SHALL contain an appropriate value in "user_version" field of the SQLite database header to indicate its version. The value SHALL be in integer with a major version, two-digit minor version, and two-digit bug-fix. For GeoPackage Version 1.2 this value is 0x000027D8 (the hexadecimal value for 10200). ^<<K4>>^
====

The maximum size of a GeoPackage file is about 140TB ^<<K4a>>^.
In practice a lower size limit MAY be imposed by the filesystem to which the file is written.
Many mobile devices require external memory cards to be formatted using the FAT32 file system which imposes a maximum size limit of 4GB.

====== File Extension Name

[[r3]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 3
====
A GeoPackage SHALL have the file extension name ".gpkg".
====

[line-through]#It is RECOMMENDED that Extended GeoPackages use the file extension ".gpkx", but this is NOT a GeoPackage requirement.#

====== File Contents

[[r4]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 4
====
A GeoPackage SHALL only contain the data elements (tables, columns, or values) and SQL constructs (views, constraints, or triggers) specified in the core of this encoding standard (<<features>>, <<tiles>>, and <<attributes>>). Extended GeoPackages MAY contain additional data elements and SQL constructs as specified through the <<extension_mechanism>>.
====

The *GeoPackage* designation is designed to provide maximum interoperability between applications. In an *Extended GeoPackage*, the extension mechanism is used to provide additional capabilities in a way that maintains interoperability as much as possible. Developers are encouraged to consider the implications of extensions when designing their applications. Best practices include the following:

* Designing in a way that anticipates the presence of unexpected extensions, e.g., gracefully handling unexpected columns, values, or encodings.
* Using the <<extension_rtree>> extension for GeoPackages containing a non-trivial amount of vector data.
* Using the <<extension_crs_wkt>> extension, which is strongly recommended due to inherent weaknesses in the original standard for encoding coordinate reference systems.

[[r5]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 5
====
The columns of tables in a GeoPackage SHALL only be declared using one of the data types specified in table <<table_column_data_types>>. Extended GeoPackages MAY contain additional data types as specified through the <<extension_mechanism>>.

====

A table named `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys` is the first component of the standard SQL schema for simple features described in clause <<sfsql_intro>> below.
The coordinate reference system definitions it contains are referenced by the GeoPackage `gpkg_contents` and `gpkg_geometry_columns` tables to relate the vector and tile data in user tables to locations on the earth.

The `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys` table includes the columns specified in SQL/MM (ISO 13249-3) <<12>> and shown in <<gpkg_spatial_ref_sys_cols>> below containing data that defines spatial reference systems.
Views of this table MAY be used to provide compatibility with the http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=53698[SQL/MM] <<12>> (see <<sqlmm_gpkg_spatial_ref_sys_sql>>) and OGC http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25354[Simple Features SQL] <<9>><<10>><<11>> (Table 21) standards.

====== Table Data Values

[[r14]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 14
====
The `table_name` column value in a `gpkg_contents` table row SHALL contain the name of a SQLite table or view.
====

The `data_type` specifies the type of content contained in the table, for example "features" per clause <<features>>, "attributes" per clause <<attributes>>, "tiles" per clause <<tiles>>, or an implementer-defined value for other data tables per clause in an Extended GeoPackage.

The `last_change` SHOULD contain the timestamp of when the content in the referenced table was last updated, in ISO8601 format. Note that since it is not practical to ensure that this value is maintained properly in all cases, this value should be treated as informative.

[[r15]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 15
====
Values of the `gpkg_contents` table `last_change` column SHALL be in http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=40874[ISO 8601] <<29>> format containing a complete date plus UTC hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a second, with a 'Z' ('zulu') suffix indicating UTC. The ISO8601 format is as defined by the strftime function '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ' format string applied to the current time. ^<<K7>>^
====

The `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` column values describe the bounding box (extents) of the content, in the units specified by the row's `srs_id` column value.

[WARNING]
=====
For _tiles_ content, the extents are _informative_; there is no requirement that these extents be exact or represent the minimum bounding box of the content. To provide a better user experience for sparsely populated tiles matrix sets, applications may use this bounding box as the extents of a default view. For the actual extents of a tile matrix set, see <<gpkg_tile_matrix_set_cols>>.
=====

[[r16]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 16
====
Values of the `gpkg_contents` table `srs_id` column SHALL reference values in the `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys` table `srs_id` column.
====

[NOTE]
===========
When `data_type` is "features", the `srs_id` also matches `gpkg_geometry_columns.srs_id` (see <<r146>>). When `data_type` is "tiles", the `srs_id` also matches `gpkg_tile_matrix_set.srs_id` (see <<r147>>).
