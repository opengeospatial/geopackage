== Conformance
This standard identifies nine (9) conformance classes.
One conformance class is defined for each package in the UML model.
Each conformance class is defined by one requirements class.

Only the Core conformance class is mandatory; all other conformance classes are optional.
In the case where a conformance class has a dependency on another conformance class, that conformance class should also be implemented.

The tests in Annex A are organized by Requirements Class.
For example, an implementation of the Core conformance class must pass all tests specified in Annex A for the Core requirements class.
