== Introduction

Mobile device users who require map/geospatial application services and operate in disconnected or limited network
connectivity environments are challenged by limited storage capacity and the lack of open format geospatial data to
support these applications. The current situation is that each map/geospatial application requires its own potentially
proprietary geospatial data store. These separate application-specific data stores may contain the same geospatial data,
wasting the limited storage available, and requiring custom applications for data translation, replication, and
synchronization to enable different map/geospatial applications to share the same world view. In addition, many existing
geospatial data stores are platform-specific, which means that users with different platforms must translate data to
share it.

An open, standards-based, application-independent, platform-independent, portable, interoperable, self-describing,
GeoPackage (GPKG) data container, API and manifest are needed to overcome these challenges and to effectively support
multiple map/geospatial applications such as fixed product distribution, local data collection, and geospatially enabled
analytics. This standard is intended to facilitate widespread adoption and use of GeoPackages by both COTS and
open-source software applications on enterprise production platforms as well as mobile hand-held devices, given that
mobile hand held devices do not yet have the processing power or battery life to effectively tackle difficult geospatial
product production and analysis tasks. An application that accesses a GPKG will make use of the GPKG capabilities it
requires; few if any such applications will make use of all GPKG capabilities.

This OpenGIS ® Implementation Specification defines GeoPackage files for exchange and GeoPackage SQLite Extensions for
direct use of vector geospatial features and / or tile matrix sets of earth images and raster maps at various scales.
Direct use means the ability to access and update data in a “native” format without intermediate format translations in
an environment (e.g. through an API) that guarantees data model and data set integrity and identical access and update
results in response to identical requests from different client applications.

A **GeoPackage file** is a platform-independent SQLite database file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables
shown in <<geopackage_tables_figure>>, with specified definitions, integrity assertions, format limitations and content
constraints.

A GeoPackage file MAY be “empty” (contain user data table(s) for vector features and/or tile matrix pyramids with no row
record content) ) or contain one or many vector feature type records and /or one or many tile matrix pyramid tile
images. GeoPackage file metadata can describe GeoPackage data contents and identify external data synchronization
sources and targets. A GeoPackage file MAY contain spatial indexes on feature geometries and SQL triggers to maintain
indexes and enforce content constraints.

A GeoPackage SQLite Extension that MAY provide a minimal set of SQL API runtime functions to support spatial indexes and
SQL triggers linked to a SQLite library with specified configuration requirements to provide SQL API access to a
GeoPackage file. A GeoPackage is a GeoPackage file used with a GeoPackage SQLite Extension. A GeoPackage MAY have
extensions that are registered in the gpkg_extensions table.

This specification does not address the issues listed in the B.6 Potential Future Work clause in Annex B, which MAY be
addressed in a subsequent version of this specification or by other specifications.
