== Scope
A GeoPackage <<geopackage>> is a platform-independent SQLite <<sqlite>> database file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables.
GeoPackage is designed to be extensible, including support for additional data types.

This document defines an extension that allows a GeoPackage to contain additional data that is related to geospatial (generally, but not exclusively, features) or attributes data.
As an example, this can be used to establish a many-to-many relationship between features (e.g. points, lines, or areas) and multimedia files.
