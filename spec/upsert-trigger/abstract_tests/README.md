This folder contains the Abstract Test Suite.

Each file describes a single test. The naming convention for these files is:

"TESTn.adoc" where "n" corresponds to the test number. Numbers should have preceeding zeros appropriate for the total number of tests in the project (e.g., the first test could be TEST001 if less than 1000 tests are anticipated).

The test is expressed according to this pattern:

NOTE: for each test, there should be a corresponding requirement in the "requirements" folder.
