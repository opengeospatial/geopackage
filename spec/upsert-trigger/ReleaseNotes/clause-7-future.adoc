//OPTIONAL: Describe any Change Requests or Issues which are planned to be addressed in a future version of the standard.

The SWG did discuss Issue 553 - Request to allow multiple channels in a GeoPackage Coverage. The SWG determined in principle that the aims of issue 553 require at least a new requirements class, if not an entirely new extension. Therefore the SWG agreed to table this issue so that the SWG can produce a pull request containing proposed text. This is a substantive change that will require a formal SWG motion and vote.
