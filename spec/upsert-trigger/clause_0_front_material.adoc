[big]*i.     Abstract*

The "GeoPackage Extension for Upsert Compatible Triggers” (UCTE) extension defines how to encode GeoPackage triggers that are compatible with the SQLite upsert operation.
The original triggers were written without this consideration and will fail .
This extension allows upsert-compatible triggers to be used without negatively affecting GeoPackage clients that are not aware of the extension.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

The "GeoPackage RTree Extension” has been part of the GeoPackage Encoding Standard since Version 1.0.
In 2022, a problem was identified where the triggers provided to maintain RTree indexes would fail with a unique constraint violation if an upsert statement is used.
The following is an example of an upsert:

  INSERT INTO foo (fid, geom) VALUES (1, put_here_some_gpkg_geometry_blob) on conflict (fid) DO UPDATE SET geom=excluded.geom;

The resolution to this problem is to replace the existing `_update1` trigger with two separate triggers.
This extension is designed to advertise to clients that the upsert-compatible triggers are in place.

The following information is provided in compliance with the GeoPackage Extension template as defined in Annex E: GeoPackage Extension Template of the GeoPackage Standard. These additional introductory clauses are not elements in the standard OGC document template.

* Extension Author: GeoPackage SWG, author_name of `gpkg` will be assigned if this extension is adopted by OGC.
* Extension Name or Template: `upsert_compatible_triggers`, alias of `gpkg_upsert_compatible_triggers` will be assigned if this extension is adopted by OGC.
* Extension Type: This extension has a dependency on http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#extension_rtree[_Annex F.3_]footnote:[The GeoPackage RTree Extension (Clause F.3)The RTree Spatial Indexes extension provides a means to encode an RTree index for geometry values in a GeoPackage.].
* Applicability: This GeoPackage Extension for Upsert Compatible Triggers can be used on any GeoPackage where feature data is indexed in accordance with the RTree Extension.
This extension specifies requirements and optional clauses for new triggers.
* Scope: write-only
