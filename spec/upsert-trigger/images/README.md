Image files for graphics go here.

Each graphic is a separate file with the naming convention:

"FIGn.xxx" where "n" is a number with leading zeroes appropriate for the total number of figures and "xxx" is the appropriate extension for the file type.

or, for other graphics not associated with figures:

"GRPn.xxx" where "n" is a sequential number with leading zeroes appropriate for the total number of graphics and "xxx" is the appropriate extension for the file type.
