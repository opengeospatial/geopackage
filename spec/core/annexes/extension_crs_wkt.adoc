=== WKT for Coordinate Reference Systems

[float]
==== Introduction

The OGC GeoPackage standard was adopted prior to the adoption of "12-063r5 OGC Well known text representation of Coordinate Reference Systems" <<I34>>, in 13 August, 2014. As a result, the OGC GeoPackage standard references an older document <<I32>> which has known ambiguities that are being encountered in the field. This extension establishes a new column to contain values that conform to the new standard.
OGC later adopted "18-010r7 OGC Well known text representation of Coordinate Reference Systems" <<I36>>, in 6 June, 2019 as a revision to 12-063r5.

[float]
==== Requirements
[float]
===== Table Definition
[float]
====== gpkg_spatial_ref_sys
[[r115]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 115
====
For GeoPackages conforming to this extension, the `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys` table SHALL have an additional column called `definition_12_063` as per <<gpkg_spatial_ref_sys_cols_crs_wkt>> and <<gpkg_spatial_ref_sys_crs_wkt_sql>>.

|Column Name |Column Type |Column Description |NOT NULL flag |Key
|`srs_name` |TEXT |Human readable name of this SRS |true |
|`srs_id` |INTEGER |Unique identifier for each Spatial Reference System within a GeoPackage |true |PK
|`organization` |TEXT |Case-insensitive name of the defining organization e.g. EPSG or epsg |true |
|`organization_coordsys_id` |INTEGER |Numeric ID of the Spatial Reference System assigned by the organization |true |
|`definition` |TEXT |Well-known Text <<I32>> Representation of the Spatial Reference System |true|
|`description` |TEXT |Human readable description of this SRS |false|
|`definition_12_063` |TEXT |Well-known Text <<I34>> or <<I36>> Representation of the Spatial Reference System |true|
|====

[NOTE]
====
Previous versions of this extension specified default values for `definition` and `definition_12_063`. Those defaults have been removed for interoperability reasons but implementers should be aware that some GeoPackages may have these defaults in place.

===== Table Data Values

[float]
====== gpkg_extensions
[[r145]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 145
====
GeoPackages with a row in the `gpkg_extensions` table with an `extension_name` of "gpkg_crs_wkt" SHALL comply with this extension.
GeoPackages complying with this extension SHALL have a row in the `gpkg_extensions` table as described in <<CRSWKTExtensionTableRecord>> (below).
====

[WARNING]
=====
Requirement 145 has been updated as part of GeoPackage 1.2.1.
In 1.1.0 and 1.2.0, the `table_name` and `column_name` column values of the required `gpkg_extensions` row were inadvertently left unspecified.
While the executable test suite running on an older GeoPackage version will not generate a failure due to missing `gpkg_extensions` column values, it is recommended to update these values to comply with the updated requirement on older versions as well.

[NOTE]
=====
For the `definition` column, use a hyperlink that describes the current implementation of this extension.
While a URL like http://www.geopackage.org/spec/#extension_crs_wkt is acceptable, permalinks to specific versions are provided upon publication using the URL pattern http://www.geopackage.org/specMmP/#extension_crs_wkt where `M` is the major version, `m` is the minor version, and `P` is the patch. For example http://www.geopackage.org/spec121/#extension_crs_wkt is the permalink for this extension for GeoPackage 1.2.1.

.Requirement 116
====
Values of the `definition_12_063` column SHALL be constructed per the WKT syntax in <<I34>> and <<I36>>.
====

[NOTE]
====
For backwards compatibility, only use common WKT values between 12-063 and 18-010.
Additional WKT values in 18-010r7 can be used when required in the CRS definition.
====


[[r117]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 117
====
At least one definition column SHALL be defined with a valid definition unless the value of the `srs_id` column is `0` or `-1`. Both columns SHOULD be defined. If it is not possible to produce a valid <<I32>> definition then the value of the `definition` column MAY be `undefined`. If it is not possible to produce a valid <<I34>> or <<I36>> definition then the value of the `definition_12_063` column MAY be `undefined`.
====

[NOTE]
====
If, for a particular row, both the `definition` and `definition_12_063` columns are populated, the value in the `definition_12_063` column takes priority.
