=== Geometry Type Triggers 

[NOTE]
=====================
On August 15, 2016 the GeoPackage SWG voted to remove this extension from the standard due to interoperability concerns. For more information see the release notes. The original extension may be found in http://www.geopackage.org/spec110/#extension_geometry_type_triggers.
