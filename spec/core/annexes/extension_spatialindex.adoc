=== R-tree Spatial Indexes

[float]
==== Introduction

The R-tree Spatial Indexes extension provides a means to encode an R-tree index for geometry values in a GeoPackage.
An R-tree index <<B28>> provides a significant performance advantage for searches with basic envelope spatial criteria that return subsets of the rows in a feature table with a non-trivial number (thousands or more) of rows.^<<K26>>^

[float]
==== Extension Author

GeoPackage SWG, author_name `gpkg`.

[float]
==== Extension Name or Template

`gpkg_rtree_index`

[float]
==== Extension Type

New Requirement dependent on clauses <<gpb_format>> and <<extension_geometry_encoding>>.

[float]
==== Applicability

This extension applies to any column specified in the `gpkg_geometry_columns` table.

[float]
==== Scope

Write-only, because it does not change the result of reads, although it may improve their performance.

[float]
==== Requirements

This extension uses the R-tree implementation provided by the SQLite R*Tree Module extension documented at <http://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html>.

[float]
===== GeoPackage
[[r75]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 75
====
The "gpkg_rtree_index" extension name SHALL be used as a `gpkg_extensions` table `extension_name` column value to specify implementation of spatial indexes on a geometry column.
====

[[r76]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 76
====
A GeoPackage that implements spatial indexes SHALL have a `gpkg_extensions` table that contains a row for each spatially indexed column with `extension_name` "gpkg_rtree_index", the `table_name` of the table with a spatially indexed column, the `column_name` of the spatially indexed column, and a `scope` of "write-only".
====

[[r77]]
[caption=""]
.Requirement 77
====
A GeoPackage SHALL implement spatial indexes on feature table geometry columns using the SQLite Virtual Table R-trees and triggers specified below.
The tables below contain SQL templates with variables.
Replace the following template variables with the specified values to create the required SQL statements: +
<t>: The name of the feature table containing the geometry column +
<c>: The name of the geometry column in <t> that is being indexed +
<i>: The name of the integer primary key column in <t> as specified in <<r29>>
====

[float]
====== Create Virtual Table

R-tree spatial indexes on geometry columns SHALL be created using the SQLite Virtual Table R-tree extension.
An application that creates a spatial index SHALL create it using the following SQL statement template:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE rtree_<t>_<c> USING rtree(id, minx, maxx, miny, maxy)
----

where <t> and <c> are replaced with the names of the feature table and geometry column being indexed.
The R-tree function id parameter becomes the virtual table 64-bit signed integer primary key id column, and the min/max x/y parameters are min- and max-value pairs (stored as 32-bit floating point numbers) for each dimension that become the virtual table data columns that are populated to create the spatial R-tree index.

[float]
====== Load Spatial Index Values

The indexes provided by the SQLite Virtual Table R-tree extension are not automatic indexes.
This means the index data structure needs to be manually populated, updated and queried.
Each newly created spatial index SHALL be populated using the following SQL statement

[source,sql]
----
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c>
  SELECT <i>, ST_MinX(<c>), ST_MaxX(<c>), ST_MinY(<c>), ST_MaxY(<c>) FROM <t> WHERE <c> NOT NULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(<c>);
----

where <t> and <c> are replaced with the names of the feature table and geometry column being indexed and <i> is replaced with the name of the feature table integer primary key column.

[float]
====== Define Triggers to Maintain Spatial Index Values

For each spatial index in a GeoPackage, corresponding insert, update and delete triggers that update the spatial index SHALL be present on the indexed geometry column.
These spatial index triggers SHALL be defined as follows:

[source,sql]
----
/* Conditions: Insertion of non-empty geometry
   Actions   : Insert record into R-tree */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_insert AFTER INSERT ON <t>
  WHEN (new.<c> NOT NULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c> VALUES (
    NEW.<i>,
    ST_MinX(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxX(NEW.<c>),
    ST_MinY(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxY(NEW.<c>)
  );
END;

/* rtree_<t>_<c>_update1 is deprecated and is replaced by
    rtree_<t>_<c>_update6 and rtree_<t>_<c>_update7 */

/* Conditions: Update of geometry column to empty geometry
               No row ID change
   Actions   : Remove record from R-tree */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update2 AFTER UPDATE OF <c> ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> = NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> ISNULL OR ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id = OLD.<i>;
END;

/* rtree_<t>_<c>_update3 is deprecated and is replaced by
    rtree_<t>_<c>_update5 */

/* Conditions: Update of any column
               Row ID change
               Empty geometry
   Actions   : Remove record from R-tree for old and new <i> */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update4 AFTER UPDATE ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> != NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> ISNULL OR ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id IN (OLD.<i>, NEW.<i>);
END;

/* Conditions: Update of any column
               Row ID change
               Non-empty geometry
   Actions   : Remove record from R-tree for old <i>
               Insert record into R-tree for new <i> */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update5 AFTER UPDATE ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> != NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> NOTNULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id = OLD.<i>;
  INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c> VALUES (
    NEW.<i>,
    ST_MinX(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxX(NEW.<c>),
    ST_MinY(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxY(NEW.<c>)
  );
END;

/* Conditions: Update a non-empty geometry with another non-empty geometry
   Actions   : Replace record from R-tree for <i> */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update6 AFTER UPDATE OF <c> ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> = NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> NOTNULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>)) AND
       (OLD.<c> NOTNULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(OLD.<c>))
BEGIN
  UPDATE <t> SET
    minx = ST_MinX(NEW.<c>),
    maxx = ST_MaxX(NEW.<c>),
    miny = ST_MinY(NEW.<c>),
    maxy = ST_MaxY(NEW.<c>)
  WHERE id = NEW.<i>;
END;

/* Conditions: Update a null/empty geometry with a non-empty geometry
   Actions   : Insert record into R-tree for new <i> */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update7 AFTER UPDATE OF <c> ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> = NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> NOTNULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>)) AND
       (OLD.<c> ISNULL OR ST_IsEmpty(OLD.<c>))
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO rtree_<t>_<c> VALUES (
    NEW.<i>,
    ST_MinX(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxX(NEW.<c>),
    ST_MinY(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxY(NEW.<c>)
  );
END;

/* Conditions: Row deleted
   Actions   : Remove record from R-tree for old <i> */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_delete AFTER DELETE ON <t>
  WHEN old.<c> NOT NULL
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id = OLD.<i>;
END;
----

where <t> and <c> are replaced with the names of the feature table and geometry column being indexed and <i> is replaced with the name of the feature table integer primary key column.

[WARNING]
====
GeoPackage Versions 1.2.0 and prior have an incorrect update3 trigger that will fail in certain circumstances.
GeoPackage Version 1.2.1 fixes this issue by replacing the update3 trigger.
In GeoPackage 1.4.0, the decision was made to deprecate the update3 trigger and replace it with the new update5 trigger.
This will allow clients to easily detect whether the correct trigger is in place.
It is strongly recommended to update older GeoPackages by dropping the update3 trigger and adding the update5 trigger.
The GeoPackage Executable Test Suite has been updated to accept either version of the trigger in older versions and to mandate the corrected version in versions after 1.2.0.

In addition, GeoPackage Versions 1.3.1 and prior have a single update1 trigger that is incompatible with upsert statements.
GeoPackage Version 1.4.0 fixes this issue by replacing the update1 trigger with the new update6 and update7 triggers.
It is strongly recommended to update older GeoPackages by dropping the update1 trigger and adding the update6 and update7 triggers.
The GeoPackage Executable Test Suite will be updated to accept either version of the trigger in older versions and to mandate the corrected version in versions after 1.3.1.

If present, the deprecated triggers can be dropped with a `DROP TRIGGER` command.

DROP TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update1;

.Requirement 78
====
[line-through]#The SQL functions on geometries in this SQLite Extension SHALL operate correctly on extended geometry types specified by <<extension_geometry_encoding>> and/or <<extension_geometry_types>> when those extensions are also implemented.#
====

[NOTE]
====
The minimum bounding indexes created within the R-tree Extension for GeoPackage should reflect the appropriate bounding area for the indexed feature.
However, due to varying precision implementations, it is not practical to assert this practice through a requirement or test.
Clients should exercise care when using these indexes during queries because the SQLite R-tree module might link:https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html#roundoff_error[round bounding boxes slightly outward] (up to 0.000012%).
Queries using spatial indexes should contain slightly expanded bounding boxes to guard against this.
