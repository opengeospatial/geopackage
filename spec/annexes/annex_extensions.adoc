== Spatial Index SQL (Normative)

The tables below contain SQL templates with variables.  Replace the following template variables with the specified
values to create the required SQL statements:
<t>: The name of the feature table containing the geometry column
<c>: The name of the geometry column in <t> that is being indexed
<i>: The name of the integer primary key column in <t> as specified in Req 25

=== Create Virtual Table SQL Template

GeoPackage files MAY contain a spatial index for each geometry column of a feature table.
These spatial indexes SHALL be created using the SQLite Virtual Table RTree extension. An
application that creates a spatial index SHALL create it using the following SQL statement
template:

.create virtual table SQL
[source,sql]
----
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE rtree_<t>_<c> USING rtree(id, minx, maxx, miny, maxy)
----

where <t> and <c> are replaced with the names of the feature table and geometry column
being indexed. The rtree function id parameter becomes the virtual table 64-bit signed integer
primary key id column, and the min/max x/y parameters are min- and max-value pairs (stored
as 32-bit floating point numbers) for each dimension that become the virtual table data
columns that are populated to create the spatial rtree index.

=== Load Spatial Index Values

The indexes provided by the SQLite Virtual Table RTree extension are not automatic indices.
This means the index data structure needs to be manually populated, updated and queried.
Each newly created spatial index SHALL be populated using the following SQL statement

.load spatial index values SQL
[source,sql]
----
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c>
  SELECT <i>, st_minx(<c>), st_maxx(<c>), st_miny(<c>), st_maxy(<c>) FROM <t>;
----

where <t> and <c> are replaced with the names of the feature table and geometry column
being indexed and <i> is replaced with the name of the feature table integer primary key column.

=== Define Triggers to Maintain Spatial Index Values

For each spatial index in a GeoPackage file, corresponding insert, update and delete triggers
that update the spatial index SHALL be present on the indexed geometry column. These
spatial index triggers SHALL be defined as follows:

.Spatial Index SQL Triggers Template
[source,sql]
----
/* Conditions: Insertion of non-empty geometry
   Actions   : Insert record into rtree */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_insert AFTER INSERT ON <t>
  WHEN (new.<c> NOT NULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c> VALUES (
    NEW.<i>,
    ST_MinX(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxX(NEW.<c>),
    ST_MinY(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxY(NEW.<c>)
  );
END;

/* Conditions: Update of geometry column to non-empty geometry
               No row ID change
   Actions   : Update record in rtree */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update1 AFTER UPDATE OF <c> ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> = NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> NOTNULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c> VALUES (
    NEW.<i>,
    ST_MinX(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxX(NEW.<c>),
    ST_MinY(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxY(NEW.<c>)
  );
END;

/* Conditions: Update of geometry column to empty geometry
               No row ID change
   Actions   : Remove record from rtree */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update2 AFTER UPDATE OF <c> ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> = NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> ISNULL OR ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id = OLD.<i>;
END;

/* Conditions: Update of any column
               Row ID change
               Non-empty geometry
   Actions   : Remove record from rtree for old <i>
               Insert record into rtree for new <i> */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update3 AFTER UPDATE OF <c> ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> != NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> NOTNULL AND NOT ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id = OLD.<i>;
  INSERT OR REPLACE INTO rtree_<t>_<c> VALUES (
    NEW.<i>,
    ST_MinX(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxX(NEW.<c>),
    ST_MinY(NEW.<c>), ST_MaxY(NEW.<c>)
  );
END;

/* Conditions: Update of any column
               Row ID change
               Empty geometry
   Actions   : Remove record from rtree for old and new <i> */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_update4 AFTER UPDATE ON <t>
  WHEN OLD.<i> != NEW.<i> AND
       (NEW.<c> ISNULL OR ST_IsEmpty(NEW.<c>))
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id IN (OLD.<i>, NEW.<i>);
END;

/* Conditions: Row deleted
   Actions   : Remove record from rtree for old <i> */
CREATE TRIGGER rtree_<t>_<c>_delete AFTER DELETE ON <t>
  WHEN old.<c> NOT NULL
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM rtree_<t>_<c> WHERE id = OLD.<i>;
END;
----

where <t> and <c> are replaced with the names of the feature table and geometry column
being indexed and <i> is replaced with the name of the feature table integer primary key column.
