=== Background

An open standard non-proprietary platform-independent GeoPackage container for distribution and direct use of all kinds of geospatial data will increase the cross-platform interoperability of geospatial applications and web services. Standard APIs for access and management of GeoPackage data will provide consistent query and update results across such applications and services. Increased interoperability and result consistency will enlarge the potential market for such  applications and services, particularly in resource-constrained mobile computing environments like cell phones and tablets. GeoPackages will become the standard containers for "MyGeoData" that are used as a transfer format by users and Geospatial Web Services and a storage format on personal and enterprise devices.

This OGC® GeoPackage Encoding Standard defines a GeoPackage as a self-contained, single-file,
cross-platform, serverless, transactional, open source SQLite data container with table definitions, relational
integrity constraints, an SQL API exposed via a "C" CLI and JDBC, and manifest tables that together act as an exchange and direct-use format for multiple types of geospatial data including vector features, features with raster attributes and tile matrix pyramids, especially on mobile / hand held devices in disconnected or limited network connectivity environments.

Table formats, definitions of geometry types and metadata tables, relational integrity constraints, and SQL API are interdependent specification facets of the SF-SQL <<9>><<10>><<11>> and SQL-MM (Spatial) <<12>> standards that serve as normative references for the vector feature portion of this standard.

This standard attempts to support and use relevant raster types, storage table definitions, and metadata from widely adopted implementations and existing standards such as WMTS <<16>> and ISO metadata <<28>>, to integrate use of rasters as attributes of geospatial features, and to define relational integrity constraints and an SQL API thereon to provide a raster analogy to the SF-SQL and SF-MM data access and data quality assurance capabilities.

Conformance classes for this standard are classified as core (mandatory) and extension (optional). The simple core of an Empty GeoPackage contains two SQL tables.

Future versions of this standard may include requirements for elevation data and routes. Future enhancements to this standard, a future GeoPackage Web Service specification, and modifications to existing OGC Web Service (OWS) specifications to use GeoPackages as exchange formats may allow OWS to support provisioning of GeoPackages throughout an enterprise or information community.

=== Document terms and definitions

This document uses the standard terms defined in Subclause 5.3 of [OGC 06-121], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word "shall" (not "must") is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.

[glossary]
Empty GeoPackage::
    A GeoPackage that contains a `gpkg_spatial_ref_sys` table, a `gpkg_contents` table with row record(s) with `data_type` column values of "features" or "tiles", and corresponding features tables per clause <<features>> and/or tiles tables per clause <<tiles>> where the user data tables per clauses 2.1.6. and 2.2.8 exist but contain no rows.
Extended GeoPackage::
    A GeoPackage that contains any additional data elements (tables or columns) or SQL constructs (data types, indexes, constraints or triggers) that are not specified in this encoding standard.
geolocate::
    identify a real-world geographic location
GeoPackage file::
    a platform-independent SQLite database file that contains GeoPackage data and metadata tables with specified definitions, integrity assertions, format limitations and content constraints.
GeoPackage SQLite Configuration::
    consists of the SQLite 3 software library and a set of compile- and runtime configurations options.
GeoPackage SQLite Extension::
    a SQLite loadable extension that MAY provide SQL functions to support spatial indexes and SQL triggers linked to a SQLite library with specified configuration requirements to provide SQL API access to a GeoPackage.
georectified::
    raster whose pixels have been regularly spaced in a geographic (i.e., latitude / longitude) or projected map coordinate system using ground control points so that any pixel can be geolocated given its grid coordinate and the grid origin, cell spacing, and orientation.
orthorectified::
    georectified raster that has also been corrected to remove image perspective (camera angle tilt), camera and lens induced distortions, and terrain induced distortions using camera calibration parameters and DEM elevation data to accurately align with real world coordinates, have constant scale, and support direct measurement of distances, angles, and areas.
tile::
    a rectangular pictorial representation of geographic data, often part of a set of such elements, covering a spatially contiguous extent and sharing similar information content and graphical styling, which can be uniquely defined by a pair of indices for the column and row along with an identifier for the tile matrix.
tile matrix::
    a collection of tiles for a fixed scale
tile pyramid::
    a collection of tile matrices defined at different scales
Valid GeoPackage::
    A GeoPackage that contains features per clause <<_features>> and/or tiles per clause <<tiles>> and row(s) in the `gpkg_contents` table with `data_type` column values of "features" and/or "tiles" describing the user data tables.

=== Changes to the OGC® Abstract Specification

The OGC® Abstract Specification does not require changes to accommodate this OGC® standard.

=== Changes to OGC® Implementation Standards

None at present.

=== Potential Future Work (Informative)

Future versions of this standard MAY do the following:
* investigate GeoPackage implementation on SQLite version 4 <<B25>>.
* include requirements for elevation data and routes.
* Future enhancements to this standard, a future GeoPackage Web Service specification and modifications to existing OGC Web Service (OWS) specifications to use GeoPackages as exchange formats MAY allow OWS to support provisioning of GeoPackages throughout an enterprise.
* include additional raster / image formats, including fewer restrictions on the image/tiff format.
* include additional SQL API routines for interrogation and conversion of raster / image BLOBs.
* add infrastructure to the metadata tables such as a `temporal_columns` table that refers to the time properties of data records.
* specify a streaming synchronization protocol for GeoPackage as part of a future GeoPackage Web Service specification, and/or a future version of the GeoPackage and/or Web Synchronization Service specification(s).
* address symbology and styling information.
* include geographic / geodesic geometry types.
* create a GeoPackage Abstract Object Model to support data encodings other than SQL.
* add https://github.com/mapbox/utfgrid-spec[UTFGrid] support.

Future versions of this standard and/or one for a GeoPackage Web Service MAY do the following:
* address utilities for importing and exporting vector, raster and tile data in various formats.
* address encryption of GeoPackages and/or individual tables or column values.

=== UML Notation

The diagrams that appear in this standard are presented using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) <<B14>> static structure diagrams.
The UML notations used in this standard for RDBMS tables in a GeoPackage are described in <<uml_notation_rdbms>> below.

[[uml_notation_rdbms]]
.UML Notation for RDBMS Tables
image::umlnotationforrdbmstables.png[]

In this standard, the following two stereotypes of UML classes are used to represent RDBMS tables:

a. \<<table>> An instantiation of a UML class as an RDMBS table.
b. \<<column>> An instantiation of a UML attribute as an RDBMS table column.

In this standard, the following standard data types are used for RDBMS
columns:

a. NULL – The value is a NULL value.
b. INTEGER – A signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value
c. REAL – The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
d. TEXT – A sequence of characters, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).
e. BLOB – The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.
f. NONE – The value is a Date / Time Timestamp
